Checkers Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checkers is a classic board game, dating back to around 3000 BC. It is very simple,
but a lot of fun! Checkers is known as Draughts in England and there are multiple 
variations of it all around the world. The game is played on an 8x8 chequered board,
essentially a chess board. Each player starts with 12 pieces, placed on the dark 
squares of the board closest to them. The objective of the game is to kill all the
opponent's pieces by jumping over them.

Gameplay
~~~~~~~~

Pieces can only move diagonally on the dark squares, the light squares of the board 
are never used. A normal move is moving a piece diagonally forward one square. 
The initial pieces can only move forward diagonally, not backwards. You cannot move 
onto a square that is occupied by another piece. However, if an opponent piece is on
the square diagonally in front of you and the square behind it is empty then you can 
(and must!) jump over it diagonally, thereby killing it. If you land on a square 
where you can kill another opponent piece you must jump over that piece as well,
immediately. One turn can kill many pieces. It is required to jump over pieces 
whenever you can.

If a piece reaches the end row of the board, on the opponent's side, it becomes a
King. Kings can move diagonally forwards and backwards, making them more powerful
in jumping over opponent pieces. However, if you jump over a piece to become a
King you can not jump backwards over another piece in the same move, you have 
to wait until the next turn to start moving backwards.

Jumping over opponents is required. However, if you have two possible moves, 
where one jumps over one opponent and the other jumps over two or more opponents
you are not required to take the jump with the most opponents killed, you are just
required to take any jump move.

Winning
~~~~~~~

The game can end in two different ways:

1)If a player has lost all his pieces he loses.
2)If a player can't move at all, all his pieces are blocked, he loses.
